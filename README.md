Hello! I'm the author of KissAnime, and you can call me Alex. This program is meant to make  your entertainment easier by providing instant access to your favorite anime, cartoons, and dramas on:

1. Kissanime.com
2. Kisscartoon.me
3. Kissasian.com

I would like to give special thanks to my friends Crystal and Maddy for their support and    their suggestions during the development of the program. I give special thanks to Crystal for drawing the gorgeous lips as the project's icon. Aditionally, I would like to give credit to github user Anorov for his Python module 'cfscrape', as it forms an   integral part of InstaKiss.

Now, a bit about how to use the program. To execute the program, find the "InstaKiss.exe" file in the main folder. You may want to create a shortcut to the executable for easy access. Once you open the app, you'll be taken to the home screen. Welcome! Aside from the home screen, there are three main tabs:

A. "My Shows" -- The bread and butter of InstaKiss. Here you can view a list of the shows your watching. This tab has four                 buttons:

	1. "Continue" -- Continue the show where you left off by going to the next episode.
  
	2. "Watch selected episode" -- Watch the specific episode selected.

	3. "Set as previous episode" -- Set the selected show as the last episode you watched. This allows the "Continue" button to                                take you to the next episode. 

  4. "Back up List" -- Back up the current list in case of a file corruption, an accidental deletion, or an accidental reset.                    The file will be saved to the ...\InstaKiss\BackupLists. You may name the file if you wish. If not, the                      default file name for the list will be your current data and time. To use the backuplist, copy it into the                    main directory and rename the textfile to "animelist", overriding the original file. Restart the program.

B. "Add Show" -- Allows you to add your favorite shows to the list. First enter the name of the show. This will the name you               see in the list on the "My Shows" tab. For optimal performance, please stick to alphanumerical ASCII characters               and not special ones, e.g. ☻, ♦, ◘, ♥, etc. Then you'll need to paste (with the CTRL + V) the full link to the               shows main page from one of the three supported Kiss sites, e.g. http://kissasian.com/Drama/Amachan. Click the               button and you should see that your show has been added.

C. "Drop Show" -- The way to remove shows from the main list. You can remove any of the shows that you see named. Simply type                in the name displayed and press "Remove Show". Alternatively, you can reset the list to its default shows:                   Sailor Moon (anime), Tom and Jerry (cartoon), and Amachan (J-drama). If you're not completely sure about                     resetting, then you should back up your current list. 

Enjoy! If you find any bugs or major issues with the program, feel free to contact me via Source Forge at: elderberries@users.sourceforge.net.
